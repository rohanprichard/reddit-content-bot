The Upside Down Man

I'm a wildlife photographer. Three months ago, I was shooting in a remote forest when something appeared in my photos - a white blur in the corner of every frame. <sigh> Always the same spot.

I thought it was a lens problem. But then I saw him with my own eyes. A tall, shimmering figure hanging upside down from a tree branch. Only visible in my peripheral vision. The moment I tried to look directly, he vanished.

At the ranger station, they knew exactly what I was talking about. "The Upside Down Man," the older ranger said. <gasp> "One rule - you see him by accident, you keep looking straight ahead. Never acknowledge him. Never go looking for him."

But I'm a photographer. I hunt things with my camera. <chuckle> Big mistake.

I went back, hunting for him. Every photo made the white blur bigger, brighter, angrier. Then my camera died - could only see pure white light. So I tried using my own eyes instead.

That's when the white fog appeared in my vision. <groan> A blind spot that grew every time I tried to see him directly. He was erasing the part of my sight I used to look at him.

I ran. Got out of the forest. But it was too late. The blind spot is permanent now. And he followed me home. <whisper> He's always there, just at the edge of my vision. Hanging from telephone poles, lurking in corners.

I live in constant denial now. Never turn my head too fast. Never let my eyes wander. Because if I try to look at him again... <pause> there's not much vision left to lose.

So here's my warning - if you're ever in the deep woods and feel something watching you, if you see something impossible in your peripheral vision... <sigh> pretend you didn't. Some things aren't meant to be seen.
